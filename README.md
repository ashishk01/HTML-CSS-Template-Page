# HTML-CSS-Template-Page
I have created this web page using HTML and CSS inspired by template page from Templated.com.
to run this file simply put all images in a folder called "images" and put it in same folder as of index and css
By runnning the html page one could view the page

PS- This is just for learning purpose of HTML and CSS.
I have only tried to use several concepts.
